# Ad-Click-Through-Prediction

This project is based on the [Click-Through Rate Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction) Kaggle Competition.

## There are two python code files – 
 * ```CTR_Classifier.ipynb``` which contains the data reading, pre-processing and graph plots. It also contains all the classifier models and their performance metrics of Log Loss and Accuracy
 * ```CTR_ROC.ipynb``` which contains the python code to generate the ROC curve and AUC evaluations for the built models.

## Toy Dataset – 

The toy dataset is provided in the file ```train.csv``` . Results using toy dataset may slightly vary as compared to the results obtained from running the code on the full dataset.

## Dependencies – 

* datetime
* numpy 
* graphlab
* copy 
* sklearn
* graphviz 
* string 
* seaborn 
* matplotlib 

## Output

The classifier results are in the ipython notebooks and the generated graphs can be found in the ```Graphs``` folder.
